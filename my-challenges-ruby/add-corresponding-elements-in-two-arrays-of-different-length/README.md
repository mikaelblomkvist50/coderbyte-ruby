Inspiration https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49323929/add-corresponding-elements-in-two-arrays-of-different-length

You have two arrays, array `a` and array `b`:

```
a = [50, 17, 54, 26]
b = [19, 7, 8, 18, 36, 8, 18, 36, 18, 14]
```

Add to the elements of `b` the corresponding elements of `a`. When the elements of `a` runs out, You want to cycle through `a` to supply the elements. The result should be:

```
c = [69, 24, 62, 44, 86, 25, 72, 62, 68, 31]
```
